The island of Bosa was settled by the Mercer League nearly sixty years ago. Since that time, it has grown into a self-sustaining community of nearly one hundred vilagers. Situated in inner ring of the Sea's Edge, merchant ships traveling to the Golden Isle will often stop in Bosa to resupply and shelter in the protected harbor.

Life on the island is prosperous and peaceful, with many members of the community working in the tropical orchards, fishing in the surronding sea, or trading with nearby islands. Since most of the population has migrated here from nations along the Emerald Coast, the lush forests and abundant land is a welcome change their homelands. 

Despite the idealic lifestyles they now enjoy, many inhabitants of Bosa still have memories of The Blood Tide. Twenty years later, a decaying fort is the only monument on the island to the war for the Sea's Edge.


# The Mercer League
In response to years of torment from seafaring raiders, the elven King Reyun sought out the heads of three other nations along the Emerald Coast. The elven nation of Parsa, the Commonwealth of Jatra, the Freemen of Ra-Li, and the Citystate of Porthcall. Despite initially frictions, Reyun eventually persuaded each nation to join the Mercer League of Trade and Self Defense.

### Parsa
The elven nation of Parsa is only a little larger than a citystate but holds significant political and financial sway among its peers. Full citizens of Parsa are granted numerous privileges including military protection, access to higher learning, robust legal rights, and clemency on certain taxes. The Parsan ethos is one of hardwork, goodwill, and desire for exploration.

### Commonwealth of Jatra
Occupying only a small stretch of the Emerald Coast, the mountainous nation of Jatra extends inland along the Sanmar Range. This country is populated exclusively by a species of bipedal tortoises known for their even-tempers and financial acumen. 

### The Freemen of Ra-Li
A small democratic country on the Horn Peninsula off the Emerald Coast. The population is mostly human and worship a Chaotic God known as Ramash. The people of Ra-Li are world renowned for their quality textiles and pottery.

### Citystate of Porthcall
Porthcall is little more than a giant rock off the Emerald coast. The city state itself is perched atop the cliffs of their small island overlooking a small cove. Despite their limited space, or perhaps because of it, the population of Porthcall are quite entrepreneurial if a bit predatory. In all matters of bartering and making a quick coin, a 'Porthie' is second to none.
